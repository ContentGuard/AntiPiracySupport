# ContentGuard beta

NOTE:
This is a closed beta.  Please report new piracy markets and malware to me or any of the others involved 
with this project.  Pull requests are also welcome. For ROM developers interested in using this it makes 
more sense to track this project directly and then bridge into an existing package with correct perms 
(like settings).  This way any changes made here to the blacklisted packages and improvements will reach out 
to everyone.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me or any of the developers involved in ContentGuard..
Thank you for helping to support developers/themers!
